One more plus point this has that , the tea bags are staple free, which don't cause any harm to our health. From Jan 2018, FSSAI  has banned staple pins on tea bags, but there are companies still manufacturing tea bags with stapler pins. Use of staple pins in tea bags poses potential hazard to consumers since any loose staple pin consumed inadvertently with tea may cause serious health hazard.",

However, after trying Organic India's Tulsi Green Tea, I developed a taste for it. Packed with antioxidants, Tulsi green tea helps your body in a lot of ways. From anti-aging to stronger immunity, green tea does it all. Does not taste bitter, so one can have it twice a day. Mixing honey in it is even more beneficial !!",

Along with this, Tulsi, Ginger, Lemon are the essentials for our body resistance and cleansing. A combination with Green tea, it makes the ulitmate. I have started this 3 months back, now my parents, inlaws and myself are having it daily.I am slowly observing that I am losing the extra fat near my belly :). I am having it in the early morning after brush. I have also subscribed monthly 2 packets for me and my parents. Can't get out of this product.Great!!!!. Thanks, Sharat Salaka",

So wanted to give it a shot for the organic tea.I am not sure if it is purely organic but I no longer feel the discomfort. And the taste is amazing. I was hesitant initially about the tulsi mix but it is wonderfully blended and now I like drinking green tea.Lemon and ginger in specific adds more taste.",
