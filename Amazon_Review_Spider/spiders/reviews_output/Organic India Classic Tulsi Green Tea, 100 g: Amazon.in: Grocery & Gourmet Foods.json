When I had this Greentea for the first time I saw being very healthy and energetic no burps for long, reduced tummy, when ur sick fights the flu. People might be thinking I'm simply saying here these. I'm honestly saying this is the best medicinal and great taste green-tea. Great taste I say because I have experience of eating natural mint leaves. I would suggest people to try this than going to other brands like lipton and others.",
