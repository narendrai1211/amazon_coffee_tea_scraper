On top this provides HDL and Lauric acid which is important for healthy heart and brain. Just consume a bit daily and you will feel the difference over time.To be used in cooking-------------------------It can be used in cooking for variety of preparations. Be it in soups or curries or even in smoothies. Smoothies taste so good with coconut milk.For skin and hair-------------------It's a great conditioner and moisturizer. Mix it with oils and apply on hair and scalp and even skin for natural moisturizing.I wish they had a bigger pack as well as we use it regularly.Would highly recommend this.",
