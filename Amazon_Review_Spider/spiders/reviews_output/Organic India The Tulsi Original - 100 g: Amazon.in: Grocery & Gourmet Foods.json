It gives a robust aroma and full bodied taste.I had a cold on the day I recieved this product, I've had it twice before I wrote this review and it has already helped a lot with my cold.The product came well packed in a sturdy airtight container and you can easily use it directly from said container, no need to transfer it to another container.",
