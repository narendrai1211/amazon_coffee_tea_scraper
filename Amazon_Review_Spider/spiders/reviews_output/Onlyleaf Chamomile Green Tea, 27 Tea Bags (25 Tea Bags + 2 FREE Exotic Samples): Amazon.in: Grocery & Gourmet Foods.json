The only leaf concept of having full leaves in a see through gauze which when dipped into hot water infuses the calming aroma as well as the taste to the tea , thus helping my body to calm down. I'd totally recommend this product for all who require a little something to help them to calm their minds.Tip: it works far better when the tea bag is dipped while the water is being boiled.",

I am not disappointed at all. The product is top notch - packaging, nylon tea bags. Very premium stuff. I'm into black teas and Chinese teas, so the taste isn't a big bother. Have been having it for a few days now. Seems to be helping. Will order more in future.",

Boxing looks pretty, sachet looks so good as if you wanna buy, on top of that they are giving few 2 tea bags and honey sachet, reviews are good , all these are good but actual reality is they are not totally camomile green tea but more of Green tea.. Just very few camomiles are in there, so this is not camomile tea which has so many Benefits but a simply green tea with some flavour.. and it's true that they have added no dust in the teas just the pure leaves.. So people who are looking for camomile tea, this isn't the right choice..",

I must say I was impressed with the packaging of tea bags. They are triangular in shape unlike the generic tea bag. They contain the actual ingredients mentioned on the small satchets. One thing I love about them is that each satchet not only has a vibrant colour but also mentions the benefits of the tea inside. It really helps me choose my tea for the day. I bought this pack of chamomile tea this time because it really helps me get a good night's sleep and eases period cramps too. Only Leaf really is one of a kind. It has changed the meaning of tea time for a tea lover like me.I also received two free samples of jasmine tea along with two super cute honey twigs. I am flattered. Very very happy with the product. ðŸ¥°",
