I think it can easily beat the Tata and Red Label brands. The tea tastes very awesome and you will love it from the very first sip of the tea. I cannot expect anything better at this price and the discounts and offers provided are also good. It is a value for money product for me.",

(They usually use local tea dust)This one is very expensive for the bland taste it offers. You have to add larger quantity to get a SLIGHT strong flavour. And I wasn't surprised to learn that the LOCAL TEA DUST was much full of flavour and way cheaper.We kinda mix that dust with Society now just to bring change in strong flavours and experiment a bit. The dust didn't disappoint.A big no for this one.",
