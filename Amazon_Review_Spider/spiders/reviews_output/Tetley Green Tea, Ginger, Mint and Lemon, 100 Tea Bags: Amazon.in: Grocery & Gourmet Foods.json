It's something i am concerned about as i have read some articles online where they talk about the detrimental effects of leaving the staple on the tea bag in the hot water for a long time. I am someone who loves drinking hot tea and let the green tea infuse into the water for atleast 5 mins - so the staples are a big turn off for me. I really hope you look into this and replace them with knots which are more health friendly!",

I saw people concerned about the staple in the tea bag so i found a way. Just use a cup which is wide and not deep. I have a coffee cup and i absolutely love the way i can have my green tea in it without worrying about the staple causing any health hazard. Refer pictures for better understanding.",

Even if i use 3-4 glasses of water it still has good strength of mint flavour which is okay to me.Normally people use 1 tea bag for 1 cup/ glass ,if that's the case with you then the mint flavour will be even more concentrated/stronger.If you don't like mint then please buy something else because my mom said it's too much mint flavoured.Review by- Pallavi",

A couple of bags are punctured, so at times my cup of tea gets pretty much messed up with tea dust floating around. Wouldn’t recommend to pay more than 300 for the 100’s pack. So 3 to 2 Stars.Would recommend to try the smallest pack available before buying the 100’s.I’ve been drinking green tea for almost 5 years now. I’ve tried a number of European and Indian brands. I’ve ordered the 100 bags pack.Outer carton was damaged slightly though tea bags were intact, so I didn’t mind. Very light brew even after brewing for 5 minutes straight (I believe each bag has 1.4 grams of tea per bag where as some other brands offer 2 grams a bag). Aroma and flavor is excellent and refreshing (strong mint, light lemony, zero ginger aroma). Green tea taste is so subtle that sometimes actually one wouldn’t feel it’s greem tea. I would like slight bitterness and musky after taste, which isn’t present in this. Perfect option for people aiming to consume green tea but don’t like the taste of unflavored pure green tea.Strong tea lovers must use two tea bags per mug. It’s okay considering the flavor and price but not the best green tea out there.",

I had to order it from India, but why not?The package took almost two months to arrive and was a bit battered, but the tea bags themselves are fine.  I'm just finishing my first cup and will shortly have another.  Well worth the wait!!The charming part of the package was the string tying it with an old-school wax seal!  I'm a sucker for vintage styles!",
