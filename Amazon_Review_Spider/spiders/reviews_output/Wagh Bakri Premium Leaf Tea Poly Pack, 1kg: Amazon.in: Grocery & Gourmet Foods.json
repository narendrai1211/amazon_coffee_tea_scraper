Not other tea is strong enough we need to use 2 spoonful tea to get the right color but this one solved my problem.  It gives nice color and taste with only one spoon per cup if you boil the tea properly.  Value for money.  The strong tea lover can buy it without doubt.",

Because you will have to use 7 to 8 teaspoons of the product get desired strong tea. Where as AVT or Red Label powder teas will do the job in 3 and half teaspoons. The product is very good, no doubt on that. You may go for it if you a single person or has a nuclear family.",
