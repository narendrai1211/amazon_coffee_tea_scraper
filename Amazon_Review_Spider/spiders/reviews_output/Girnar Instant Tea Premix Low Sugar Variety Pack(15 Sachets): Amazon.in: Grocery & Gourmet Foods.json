Do not expect it to be same as one made at home as without boiling of tea leaves, it is impossible to get kadak chai. The ginger and masala are not kadak but not watery or diluted either.You can always add sugar/jaggery if you need. I add a bit of palm sugar.My only peeve is the quantity - which I find really less.My order of preference is - Ginger, masala, lemongrass and elaichi.When I am traveling or when I am really lazy, this sure is a boon.",
