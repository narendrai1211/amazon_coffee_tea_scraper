So far, the differences I've seen before and after regularly drinking GT is no bloating, fast metabolism, and clear skin given you work out at least 3 times a week. Also, if you skip drinking this, you might not see much difference to your body because those changes are very subtle, for example changes in metabolism and such. I would definitely recommend people to drink green tea for at least 2 months before you look for results.",
