I ordered this coffee a & decided to try it later as I didn't have much free time... A few days passed & one day I decided to try this coffee... The moment I put this coffee in my hot milk, the aroma it made me feel that its going to be really good... And it did came out to be very nice coffee... The flavor & the aroma was simply awesome...I was actually consuming coffee from BRU till now & I can pretty confidently tell you that its way much better than it... Nescafe is the Best... And I'm pretty sure I'll be permanently sticking to Nescafe now on...Some guys might think I am talking very basic & obvious stuff but as I told, I actually not am a coffee enthusiast... I have not tasted all the great coffee types in world & also don't have any idea about premium coffee stuff & like... I just drink coffee sometimes coz I like its taste... I can say coffee is one of my favorite drinks...And if you are new to coffee, a beginner willing to tryout this wonderful drink... I would assure you that Nescafe is Best...",

Today also I tried to place an order for Nescafe 500 gms pouch packing worth Rs. 950/- , But when I place the order there was shown delivery charges Rs. 50/- . When I am ordering 950/- Rs. and why I pay delivery charge ? So I have not order to Amazon.My last 3 experience are not good. And that is why I am not interested.Also I had order for door mat also but that product was quiet rough. It was not accepted. I had thrown all mats.RegdsShirish Shah.Ahmedabad.+91 9824038039",
