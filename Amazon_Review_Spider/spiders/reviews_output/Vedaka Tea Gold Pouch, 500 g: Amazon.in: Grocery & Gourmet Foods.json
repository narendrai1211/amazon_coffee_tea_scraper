This is the first time I am using this product and I would say nothing special about the taste and aroma. But it is value for the money as it quite cheap compared to the other brands. Don't expect a great flavor, it's just OK! and towards the softer side. Give a try, you won't regrate.",

Usually I drink Duncan's, Darjeeling tea, no doubt better in market. But as hobby I purchased  Vedaka gold tea and I received the product today (26/11/2019) at 11am. As a Egger I make (wife) two cups of tea. Really I want to say who who will reading my posts It is a more better than any other brand In market for it color and tastes flavor is as normal as. I highly recommend for its price (rs 150/500gms) parking rate rs 225So it greatly helpful for poor and middle class family (I'm also poor and unemployed). Finally thank Vedaka for low price and better tea.",

When saw the review of this product of this seller we bought and tasted this. Didn't expect this will taste so great for cheaper price it's like luxurious tea that comes near to Taj, Red label, Lipton, Assam, Darjeeling and twinnings of it's smell and taste when had through milk. Far much better than Tata Gold premium tea for this price and taste. And I have ordered more from this Amazon seller now after when tasted hatsoff to this seller for this great tea. This review I say on behalf of milk tea and light tea drinking lovers not comparing with strong tea. Masala teas and strong teas are different categories it doesn't match with this.",

I add a few teaspooons milk afterwards for taste. So the flavour of tea cuts through and takes the centre stage. I don’t drink boiled tea with milk. So my observations probably don’t apply to that style of tea.This tea is predominantly some cheap commercial variant of CTC Assam tea leaves with a sprinkling of some Darjeeling like tea leaves added to the mix - see my photo with this review.As far as flavour is concerned, it is very very muted when compared to Tata Gold and is probably closer to BB Red Label.In closing, if you like Tata Gold tea, you will NOT like this one, don’t be fooled by Amazon’s copycat branding and name.If you like Red Label tea, in the boiled variant of it with milk and sugar, this one will probably taste similar to you.",

People who love very strong tea can purchase this tea powder.",
