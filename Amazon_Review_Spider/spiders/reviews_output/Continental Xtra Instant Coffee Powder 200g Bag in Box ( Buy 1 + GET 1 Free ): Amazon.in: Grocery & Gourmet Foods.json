The best coffee I've had for a while! Just go for it.Buy it from Paytm mall app. Its cheaper there!For making it taste more yummy, do mix thr coffee first with the tiny amount of cold water to make a strong concoction. Tastes fantastic. The aftertaste of coffee and the bittersweet taste lasts after finishing thr perfect cup. Do adjust water to milk ratio according to your taste to avoid the typical instant \"Nescafe or bru\" taste! Also the package instructions to make thr coffee is perfect. Less is more with this coffee. Enjoy!",

For this case it's not printed.  As the product is non returnable I couldn't return. Even the coffee powder is not granular form. I The taste too not that good. But it's very strong.",

And, it is cost-effective in terms of price itself, further, you need only 1 teaspoonful or little less of it per cup.The other variant of Continental Instant Coffee (it has 30% Chicory) is also equally good and that one is further cheap than this 100% one.It comes in outer box and inner metallic pouch which is perfectly sealed.Best part is that price is constant and doesn't flctuate every now and then. Never found it in deal, though.Henceforth, I am likely to prefer this coffee over other brands. Made in India is further encouraging factor. It has ISI mark.",

                "review_body": "Seller: CONTINENTAL COFFEE PRIVATE LIMITEDPackaging could be improved. Seller should use a box. The cartons are usually dented and bulging out from pressure.Price: Keeps fluctuating. MRP increased by ₹50 from ₹325 to ₹375 in August 2019. I have purchased it thrice, once at ₹249 (lightning deal), once at ₹325 (full price) and once at ₹292 (deal of the day).NOTE: I used coupon code CCPL10POFF to get 10% off, the third time I ordered it. This might/might not still work later. Make sure to check under partner offers before placing the order.Pros:It is the best tasting instant coffee mixture with a 70-30 mix of coffee & chicory. It beats both Nescafé and Bru in terms of taste, in my opinion. And the Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) offer makes it the most value-for-money 70-30 instant coffee currently on Amazon. It produces a thick rich flavor, not watery and bland like many other brands. And the aroma is also good. I have been having this regularly every morning for some 3-4 months now. Will never even look twice at any other brand as long as the BOGO offer exists. My advice is to go for the 200g+200g BOGO variant instead of the much higher priced 500g variant. It comes in a cardboard carton with a silvery foil-wrapped packet inside and the coffee powder securely within it. I have yet to try Davidoff and many other more expensive brands, but among Nescafé, Bru and Continental, I would pick Continental every single time. It tastes even better than Nescafé Classic or Bru Gold too, in my opinion. They are simply too expensive, while this one is much tastier as well as value-for-money.Cons: The seller should take proper care to pack the coffee boxes carefully. They just use a single layer of plastic wrapping without any insulation. As a result, the boxes usually come dented. I have read many other reviews complaining of cartons torn open and the coffee spilling outside, but that has never been the case with me. Let's see. I hope the seller listens to the customer feedback and rectifies this in the future, at least now that they've increased the price of the product, they should be able to afford to pack it a bit better.One more minor thing I noticed is that, I'm having to use much more quantity of it to get a concentrated taste than I had to with Nescafé or Bru.Overall impression:You can blindly go for Continental if you're considering Nescafé or Bru. If you find it on a lightning deal or deal of the day, buy it in bulk for a few months in advance. It has 18 months expiry date from the date of manufacture.UPDATE:Chronically consuming this coffee is causing acidity. It was not so with Nescafé or Bru. I have been having it for a few months now and this is what I've observed: the mornings when I had it, acidity, gas and reflux followed; when I skipped it, not so. If you already have existing hyperacidity and/or are under chronic stress for a while now which can precipitate acidity, I would advise you to stay away from this coffee and stick to more well-known brands. The taste is still very good, but reducing 1 star because of this problem.",
