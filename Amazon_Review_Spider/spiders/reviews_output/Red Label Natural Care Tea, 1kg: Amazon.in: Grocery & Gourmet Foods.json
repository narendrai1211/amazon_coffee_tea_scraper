Different people have different taste buds. For me Red Label Natural Care is more exciting. have a daily dose of Ashwaganda with this great product. It is fantastic to our health in many ways. We have to appreciate brooke bond of creating such a blend.  Always Amazon gives products at good price deal. Keep it up Amazon.",

The colour is coming really nice.2. The flavour is really hard to get in local market. But it is always available in amazon also with a legitimate price. You can go for it anytimeCons:1. It is not a good option for milk tea.Packaging:1. Packaging is the best part of this 1 kg pack. Itâ€™s comes in a sealed pack.2. You do not need any other container to keep the tea after opening the pack.3. The sealed pack is enough to keep it for regular purpose the flavour will be intact.",

One item opened by nistake and naturally gifted to friends. The other packet in tact. I only request, if possible to replace one packet with Red Label Nature Care, and oblige.  Thanks",

It has a great aroma and flavor with 5 Natural Ingredients - Cardamom, Ginger, Tulsi, Mulethi and Ashwagandha that enhance our immunity system. Though the amount of ginger and cardamom very less but overall it is a good tea. If you like ginger tea like me then add extra ginger. The 1kg package comes with zip lock that's a plus point for storage. Highly recommended, give a try!",

The taste and aroma of this cup is mesmerizing, as it gives a mix of flavors. Red label has and always been a trusted brand, with this version i would say there experiment was successful. Amazon pantry has made our generations life easy with all groceries available on a single click. A big thanks to you!",
