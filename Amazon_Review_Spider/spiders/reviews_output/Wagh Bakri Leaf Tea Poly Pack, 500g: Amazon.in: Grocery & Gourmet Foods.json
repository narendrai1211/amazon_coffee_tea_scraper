I have heard this name since I was a kid and it has lived its goodwill in best tea brands available in India.Pros:1 Great aroma, colour and taste of tea.2 It has strong flavour. Requires to be used in less quantity for people with mild taste.3 Most important - This tea has neutral taste and a safe choice for family and guests who does not like specific masala or herbal tea.4 Along with this tea you can use any chai masala, ginger, elachi or tulsi leaves additionally as per your taste while boiling tea.Cons:1 It might sometimes cause mild acidity if we drink more cups of tea in a day.2 Expensive brand as compared to other local tea brands.Verdict:Coming to wagh bakri tea, I don't use it as it is...i mix this tea along with reliance brand - aarambh kadak tea. It gives excellent taste and aroma when done so.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! üëç",

It wasn't available at local stores earlier, and still it hasn't covered much yet. To be honest at first I didn't like the taste it wasn't that great, but after few more intakes I started liking it. It has a premium quantity and strong which I prefer to drink. And amazon delivered it perfectly with the perfect delivery time. Overall, I would rate 3.5 out 5 for this product.",

The tea has the distinct flavor of like Assam teas and is strong so just need a small teaspoon full of serving for 1 cup. I would not recommend using this tea for making chai where the leaves are boiled for a few mins. Instead, make this the classic tea way - put in boiling water and let it stand for 3 to 5 mins before straining out the leaves, add little milk and sugar if needed and enjoy!Wanted something dark and hearty for making chai at home. Not as dusty and powdery as what you find at most Indian grocery stores, but not as intense either. Simmered in water, milk and masala for about 20 minutes, it produces a hearty and satisfying chai to my taste. When prepared this way, it has never produced any bitterness that some of the cheaper teas can leave behind.",
