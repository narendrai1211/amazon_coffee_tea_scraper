So fellows go for it blindly give it a try and i am really sure with this decision you wont regret it.Ps :  if you guys like very strong tea then go for tata premium this one is little mild, use elaichi, ginger and honey mix it well it adds up the flavour to your tea. I hope this review help you to choose right tea for yourself.",

Because of the controversial advertising by Red Label where they said that people go to Kumbh Mela to abandon  their old age parents. Thse MNCs come to India, make money from us and than mock us, this should not be tolerated.  2. To support Indian Brands like Tata, Patanjali, Dabur, etc.",

I got it at discounted price...I got the product at 15% discounted price, as I bought the product during Super Value Days.The manufacturing date of product was just 2 and half months ago from date when I received the product in hand. Hence it is recently manufactured product. Also the product have a very good shelf life.Amazon delivered the product in very good condition and packaging of the product was just awesome. No damage. Amazing...The Amazon pantry box are very hard and during packaging they insert air filled sealed packets, so that the items don't move and pressure is absorbed by the air filled packets.Delivery of my order was just the next day morning. The delivery man took the package inside of my house, as it was heavy and kept the pantry box over a table, as I told him. I behavior of the delivery man was good.I am highly satisfied with the product and I recommend you to buy the product without any fear and hesitation. Believe me you will be satisfied after receiving the product and using it.",
