I have recently had an issue with irregular periods and I did some research this month to see if there were any DIY tricks to help with it or any home remdies to try with using birth control pills (which was recommend by my doctor to make it more regular as a solution) and I thought that would not be good solution for me so I when I did my own research online, some sources stated that I should try digesting ginger to regulate menstrual periods. Anyway, I hope and pray that this works in sha Allah. I just bought this because it has ginger to help with this issue. I also use two tea bags in a coffee mug to help boost more flavor, scent and taste because its just my preferences when it comes to drinking tea.",

The flavor is very mellow and smooth.  I have drank several cups of this tea and I am not seeing a huge different at this time, but I am also not feeling bad or having any negative effects either.  It is also very affordable and organic, both are pluses for me, especially the affordable part!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who likes to drink tea.",
