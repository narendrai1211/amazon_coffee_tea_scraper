( taste is not as strong as local tea so consider it before buying it)2. The color it produces is not as strong as regular tea  (the color is lighter than regular tea)Once you get habitual to it you will love it. I am not regular user, I am occasional user because it is costlier than the regular tea but I like it more than any other regular tea.Refer picture for product detail.Thanks.",
