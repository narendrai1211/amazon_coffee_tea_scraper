Also, the spoon was missing and the packets inside the box had no markings. I have a feeling that this is a duplicate product. Amazon needs to validated because I am going to get an old designed packed product from outside and then compare the two. The previous packs were working good on my kid but this one is not that effective, which makes my doubt even stronger but let me get an old designed pack from outside and then the picture will be clear. However, the missing spoon and the markings are just not right.",
