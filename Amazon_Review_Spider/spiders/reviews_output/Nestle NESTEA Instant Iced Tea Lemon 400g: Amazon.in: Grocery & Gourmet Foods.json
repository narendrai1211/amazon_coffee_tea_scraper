Tea taste very well when its really chilled. Every chilled sip will give a soothing effect  and refresh the body .My 5 yr old kid also liked it too much since its rich in vitamin c its good for kids also in small amount. Even guest or party and occassion this drink will fit in.Since amazon was giving free 1+1  i instantly bought the product. sipper was not provided , but i did not needed one coz i already had one.already finished the product, waiting for sme offer and will surely buy its again and again.Small size packs also avaliable. For first time users try small pack and than believe me you will buy bigger pack after use.",

Although the packet asks to put 1 tablespoon in 150 ml glass, I usually put 2 and a half spoons to make it more sweet. If you put 1 tablespoon, it may taste a little sour so decide the number of tablespoons according to your taste.(NOTE: ITS NOT WORTH IT TO PAY MORE THAN 120 FOR A PACKET. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PAY EXTRA DELIVERY FEES)",

As long as the products on sale it's good to buy it but as soon as it crosses the Rs.110/120 mark it starts to become worthless. Free sipper notwithstanding Coke's Georgia brand and Wakri as well as Liston are offering iced teas at a lesser price with similar taste and Sku's(stock keeping units). Wise up your strategy Nestle or this may become a another market you guys get kicked out of!",
