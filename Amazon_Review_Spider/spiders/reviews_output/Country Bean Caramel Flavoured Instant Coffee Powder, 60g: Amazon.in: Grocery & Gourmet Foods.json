And that's saying something, considering the amount of coffee I drink.The caramel flavour is amazing and the coffee itself is quite balanced and not too bitter or acidic as most instant coffees tend to be.I drink it mostly black and without sugar, but I'm sure it can only be improved by the addition of milk and sweetness.Although it's a bit pricey and I went through one jar in less than two weeks, I'll definitely buy it again.",
