I am adding some additional milk and sugar to make it betterUpdate : I have bought around 25 boxes in this year and a constant user. Packaging is always good and on time delivery.Preperation for best results: I use half sachet in an empty cup (100 ml size). Add little sugar and then pour hot milk. Mix it well using another glass for a refreshing cream and lather.",

Even without addition of milk it is very good. Just Go for it.Ps. \"The creamer\" is non dairy and cotains hydrogeneted fat, as the contents lists, well i don't know much about what this means",

It is a little bitter on taste.. no you usual coffee premix.. is costly too.. I tried cicy cafe .. they make better premixed.. and are well priced tooStill.. the tastes are different for different people, in case of coffee.. so I guess it’s worth a try!",

Item is not bad when you need a good taste u must put atleast 2 sachets and use it you can feel a little more taste.Cons:The package was not perfect because I opened my box the coffee pack was broken due to the poor packing quality. My suggestion is pls ensure that the item is securely packed otherwise it will be damaged.Pros:1, U can make a standard coffee2, standard taste3, also can use to diabetic patients because it's have  Low sugar.",

The package was opened already.3.5 star for coffeeI got this for 190/- I have already tried other top brands coffee of this variants .To be honest you cant even compare the taste of continental coffee to the top brands'(I am not using the name of the brand because Amazon wont allow me post my review).Well the thing is ,money matters a lot .price of 1 pouch of continental coffee is around 10 rupees while others  charges around 25 rupees .So my suggestion is,add some amount of sugar and milk powder/milk if you dont like the taste or instead of 1 pouch use 2 pouch of these coffee to feel the taste .After some days I will give another review ,may be at that time I would like the tasteEDIT:- Now I start liking the taste of this coffee.Strong",
