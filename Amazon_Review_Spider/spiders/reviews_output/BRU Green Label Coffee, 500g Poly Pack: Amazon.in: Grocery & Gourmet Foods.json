Now, if you are traditional coffee lover, you may be disappointed at first, as I was. I thought I was buying coffee. However, over time, I am becoming used to the mix of lower price with the added benefits of chicory ingestion.Chicory has high nutritional value. Dried root powder contains over 90% Inulin, a highly beneficial source of fiber (soluble and insoluble). In addition, the chicory leaves contain many sources of essential nutrients. It is also a source of energy and a natural sweetener. Chicory also imparts a somewhat bitter taste.The bottomline is that the addition of chicory actually enhances the nutritional value of the product. Of course, manufacturers save costs by cutting down on the amount of coffee they use. If you are fine with saving some costs and getting additional nutrition - highly processed coffee does not contain many nutrients - then this product is fine. Do not compare this to a 100% coffee product and you won't be disappointed. The price could be lower however.",

It has a weird taste and when I opened the other packets, I could not smell coffee but a weird off-putting smell. Very sad as this was my regular weekday coffee for years.This is our regular weekday coffee. It's not the best filter coffee you will ever have but it does the job. For weekends, we have Mysore concerns, Vasanth or Suma coffee.I love that it's available on Amazon saving me the trouble to source it here in Delhi, where filter coffee is not widely available.",
