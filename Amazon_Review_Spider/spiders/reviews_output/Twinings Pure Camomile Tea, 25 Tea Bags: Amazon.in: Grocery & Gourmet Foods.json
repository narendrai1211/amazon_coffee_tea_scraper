It’s has a mild and flowery pleasant smell.The taste is mild as well. The first time will be kinda difficult because without any sweetener it feels like sipping some hot water but the taste will grow on you. You’ll learn to adjust it after a couple of times.It has actually helped me relax and sleep better. I’m looking forward to buy more in the future .",

The third time i brought there was a difference in taste.I thought its okay, this happens and didnt want to comment on it.The fourth time i purchased and recieved the pack today and i found the blend completely off. I am not sure why this product is not consistent. I  just checked the pack i received today and it was packed in the month of March (4 months old).Again i doubt if they pack and store this product properly.This product is expensive. The least they can do is maintain the quality.",
