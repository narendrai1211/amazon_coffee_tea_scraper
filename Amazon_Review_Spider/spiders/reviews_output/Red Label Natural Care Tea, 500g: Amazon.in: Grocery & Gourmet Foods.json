I started buying this in 2017 from local stores and was very happy as it saved both, the time to prepare chai while crushing ginger, etc and the hassle of finding them to add to the tea when in a hurry. Yes the price is very much on the expensive side since you pay almost double of what you would for a normal tea. But believe me, there are times when finding a tiny piece of ginger or a piece of cardamom to add to the tea is very difficult. Moreover when making tea for a single person we usually skip the trouble of adding a little spice to it.Although the percentage of all the additives are very tiny, you'll still find a lot of it when you open the pack. All in all it is highly recommended. Just go for it once, You won't want to buy a normal tea again.Hope this review is helpful.",

This tea was suggested to me by an Indian friend of mine and I am certainly glad he did.My only complaint about it is that the packaging isn't a resealable bag or a tin, but that does not detract from the quality of this tea.
