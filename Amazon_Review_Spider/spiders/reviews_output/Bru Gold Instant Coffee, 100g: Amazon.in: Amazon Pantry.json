If you are a busy person like me you must be using soluble coffee powder. These are usually freeze-dried coffee powder made from fresh coffee beans. The Aroma and taste usually depends upon the beans you are using. Usually coffee beans are picked up from Tamilnadu. It is used in making this Bru coffee powder; Bru gold is it really fantastic I can't believe that it is of Indian Origin (better than arabica coffee beans which are imported from Africa, used in Nescafe gold which is highly over priced compared to its taste). These doesn't get solidified in humid environment like other brand powders or even it's standard Bru.Highly recommend (better than Nescafe gold)",

There is so little bitterness. This coffee tastes so fantastic even without milk/creamer!! I have been drinking cheap nescafe till now that used to be bitter. Now I have got used to coffee and I'll order more of this. This is so reasonable in price too and way better than the readymade coffee sold in market.Note: Create froth with blender and Sprinkle chocolate powder on top for top class pleasure!!",

Aur already pite ho aur yahan coffee search karte hue aaye ho to theek jagah aaye ho. Mera personal opinion hai, Bru Gold coffee market Mein maujood doosre brands ki coffee se zyada achchi hai. Iski aroma, iska Taste aur flavour is just awesome. Leather wala froth formation, coffee jise peete hi energy aajaye.Aksar log tips dete hain ki coffee toned milk Mein banao, but mera suggestion iske opposite hai. Full cream milk ko achche se garam kar ke Phir coffee banao uske sath... Wo hi sabse mast coffee hogi.",

The second bottle has been saved for display.. This is the first time that such damages  were noticed in the last four years of regular purchases. either the bottles are replaced by good ones or arrange refund for the damaged bottles of Bru Gold coffee-100gms each.=T.R.Srinivasan",
