Spicy, with a strong flavour of cardamom, nutmeg, clove, black pepper and black salt. I had never tasted Kahwa before, but if it is really this good, then i am dying for some more! It is unsuitable for people fond of 'Teaness'  of tea, like Darjeeling black tea, because it lacks that presence of tea aroma. However, the tea that this contains is perfect for the blending of spices and  it has its own distinct aroma. Very refreshing, energising and stress-busting. A must try, even from an experimental point of view.  Being a Bengali, have tasted a lot of Darjeeling and traditional Assamese tea, but this is absolutely unique. And Girnar has come up with a great concoction. Thank you Amazon for bringing this to my doorstep!",
