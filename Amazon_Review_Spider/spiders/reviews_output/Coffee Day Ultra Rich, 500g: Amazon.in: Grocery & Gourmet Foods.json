Remember to keep the coffee in an air-tight container, and don't open it too much (treat it like Tea). Here's how I make it.1. Heat up 200 ml of water just under boil (do not boil the water or the coffee will get cooked before brewing).2. Pour preferred amount of coffee ( I like my coffee to be strong, so I put one and half tea-spoon).3. Brew it for 4 minute.4. Use a cloth ( e.g. a clean handkerchief ) to filter the coffee into a glass ( Yes! You don't need expensive french presses ).5. Microwave the brewed coffee for 20 seconds.Enjoy!",

(My friends and relatives regularly gift coffees from around the world for my daily morning cup). This blend is a compromise between my choice of pure coffee and my spouse's choice of chicory blend. This factory pack does not match the freshly ground one. But this ensures I can enjoy the same coffee even after I moved from the city.",

When low quality beans are used it's a common trick to make it a dark roast to mask the quality. However this coffee was often burnt to the point that it was like drinking soot. Batches can be burnt by any coffee roaster but they shouldn't be shipped out. When two packets back to back were burnt I stopped buying more.",

Buy Charge or Perfect Roast by CCD rather, if not Mysore Royal.Edit: Chicory might be an acquired taste. I like this blend now. I am surprised at myself I have ordered it twice after the first use. Pushing the ratings to a 5 star now. Also, bought this time for 146 only.",

Coffee is an acquired taste and the making process, changes a lot of factors in the final taste of coffee.This product is as good as any packaged ground coffee can be. This coffee fits the description as mentioned, balanced coffee. I am using it for last 3 years and in my course of enjoying it, I have found it to be a bit different as sometimes, the ground is a tad bit different sometimes and freshness is also a matter here. Preparation method also yield a different taste.This is not something which I enjoy complete black, as it tends to be much bitter and sour sometimes. Also, flavor notes are missing sometimes. Crema is also very low in yield here. As for Aroma, it's lacking in that part. This is a strong coffee but not smooth enough for me to rate higher.As of now, this is something which fits my monthly budget and people do enjoy it. Just don't expect some fine tones here, as it is just serving the purpose of being a budget coffee with a nice presence.",
