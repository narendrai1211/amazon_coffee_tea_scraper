Though I shared feedback with Only Leaf team, I didn't review that order because of DTDC's bad service. Maybe I would have given 3/5. This week I ordered sample box. They are excellent. Loved the only leaf concept. This is how green tea bag should be. If you want to know the difference clearly, just have Only Leaf green tea today and any of other brands like Lipton, Tetley green tea. One can easily know the difference. I used Lipton for almost 2 years. Then I tried this because Chamomile tea is not available in Lipton/Tetley. From now on I will be using this. If anyone is thinking to buy this, without second thought go ahead. I suggest you to buy a sample pack 1st & try them, so that you can order your favourite flavors from next order.",

One of my seniors recommended me 'only leaf' and I just loved it!There are actually leaves, turmeric pieces, tulsi leaves, lemongrass etc inside the tea bag.Only leaf is costing more or less same as the other green teas in the market so, why not ONLY LEAF? It's better than others.All the flavors are good but I particularly liked the kahwa green tea.",
