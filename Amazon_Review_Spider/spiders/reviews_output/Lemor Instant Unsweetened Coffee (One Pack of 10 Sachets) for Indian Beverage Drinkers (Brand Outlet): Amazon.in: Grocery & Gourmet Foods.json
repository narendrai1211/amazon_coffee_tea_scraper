A coffee drunkard ofcourse.As I have moved into a new city, away from home, one thing that bothered me and my mom who fidgeted alot to allow me to pursue my career, is: how will I survive without hot coffee.As I have moved in to a new place, have no kitchen of mine.. so had to buy coffee from cafe's and hotels. Still, they make coffee their way, add loads of sugar, less coffee powder and milk and call that weird recipe as coffee which almost broke my heart.. and they charge way too much than fair. And then as I have ordered an electric kettle for myself thinking i can atleast make hot black coffee for me and drink.. somehow i ended up searching amazon for a ready to drink coffee mix.. most of the results are full of sugar. 'I would rather settle for black coffee rather than buying sugar mixed high priced premixes'.. was what exactly i was muttering to myself.. and then this product came in suggestions for me.. and I thought to give it a try, as it says \"unsweetened\".. so I've ordered this one.Today morning I've received this one, and already used two :)Need i say more !?It's truly heartwarming experience. Just add hotwater as directed on the carton, and stir it.. start sipping ðŸ¤—Loved it!Con : Delivery charges are extremely high ðŸ™„ðŸ˜³",
