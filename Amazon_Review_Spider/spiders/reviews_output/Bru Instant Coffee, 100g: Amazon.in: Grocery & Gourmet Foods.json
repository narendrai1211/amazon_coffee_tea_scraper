Recently i tried Continental Coffee at my relatives home which i found it very tasty. So, I bought continental coffee : Instant south blend which is absolutely having a good taste. So, I thought why should i encourage a british brand when i can find an indian brand which is more tasty and has good value for money.So, Why don't you try that one?",

And then there is that strange odour every time I open the jar as well as when I am sipping it. It’s not a 100% coffee as you can see on its packet. Its of 70% coffee and 30% chicory which is used as a “substitute” to the coffee and probably the reason for it’s awkward smell and taste. Would never buy it and since nescafe gold is out of stock, going back to my home nescafe classic..:p",
