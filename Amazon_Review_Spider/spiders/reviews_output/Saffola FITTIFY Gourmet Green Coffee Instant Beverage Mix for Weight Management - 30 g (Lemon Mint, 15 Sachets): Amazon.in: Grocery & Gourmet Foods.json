The box contains 15 sachets with each sachet containing 2g of Green Coffee. So yes this product price is quite high, but its overall product is great. I would be happy to rate this product at 5 stars if it was sold for Rs.150.TASTE=====>> Though it's Lemon Mint flavor, you won't find the strong sourness of Lemon or the mint taste. The taste of lemon and mint is mild and Green Coffee's taste is more. But overall this flavor was the best among all Fittify Green Coffee.As per the pack it's curated by Chef Kunal Kapoor, but for such a simple drink i don't know why a chef is required.Anyway taste is subjective so i would leave it to you to try it out and see which suits your taste buds.>> I had an impression that Green Coffee will be bitter, but it wasn't for me. If you drink Green Tea then you will like this Green Coffee. But if you haven't taken Green Tea or Green Coffee then yes you will feel it a little bitter when you drink without sugar (recommended).>> It's best to be taken as a light brew, which means no milk and no sugar. I tried adding little honey and it was not that great. So take it with warm or hot water. It dissolves quickly and there is no residue, no filtration is required (see video).>> To be honest, it might taste like having a hot beverage with some leaves, but with 2 - 3 cups you will start liking the taste, as it's very refreshing than drinking Green Tea.SMELL=====>> Definitely you won't get the smell of roasted grounded brown coffee, and it smells a little lemony and slight plant or mint like smell. Not intense and is mild,>> The smell is refreshing than Green Tea. It does make you a active.INGREDIENTS===========>> Green Coffee (30%)>> Insulin - Chicory Root Extract - Chicory root is a blue-flowered herb that grows throughout North America and Europe. It is a type of sugar, but it has little to no impact on your blood sugar. (found more info on Google)>> Maltodextrin - Maltodextrin is used to improve the mouthfeel of beverages. It's used as an inexpensive additive to thicken food products or in plain terms - Thickener or Filler.>> Lemon and Mint flavoring substance (7%)BENEFITS========>> Green Coffee has 3 times more antioxidant than regular roasted coffee and higher than Green Tea as per some health forums.>> Green coffee restricts the absorption of foods containing high glucose, thereby reducing the calorie intake from carbs.>> Works as a catalyst in the oxidation of fat and helps the release of fatty acids, thereby helping to reduce weight.>> Improves metabolism and stimulates the absorption of fat in the liver do fat does not get stored in body.>> Helps regulate blood sugar.PACKAGE=======>> The box has 15 sachets, each sachet containing 2 grams of green coffee. So 15*2 = 30g per box.>> The packaging was good, box completely sealed in a polythene wrapper, and during shipping there was no damage.>> Each sachets will be be tough to tear as each sachet's inside has aluminum or some kind of material is keep the aroma intact and coffee powder fresh for long. Use a scissor to tear open.>> You also get Rs.200 FitCash points from Revofit which can be used for buying something from the app. i didn't use as it wasn't that great.>> Shipping was fast with Prime.HOW I USE=========I am loosing weight for sure and here is how i do it>> Morning Mountain Honey  + Apple cider vinegar + lemon juice + warn water>> Avoid or minimize rice, avoid sugar completely. If there is a pressing need use Palm sugar or organic jaggery but try to avoid.>> Green Tea around 11am>> 'Saffola Fittify Lemon Mint Green Coffee' around 3pm>> Whey Isolate Protein supplement in evening and then 3km walk everyday.>> Eat light and until you mind says you are full. Don't overeat.>> Drink lots of water.>> If possible read books related to Weight Loss for motivation :)MY THOUGHTS============>> When you look at the ingredient, only 30% of 2g is Green Coffee, 7% of 2g is Lemon and Mint flavoring substance, and rest is just filler. So for Rs.260 the product is expensive. The ideal price can be Rs.150.>> Though its expensive, when compared to Green Tea, it's more refreshing in smell and feel, has 3 times more antioxidant and am trying to loose weight. So yes am going to buy few more packs until i reach my goal and maybe shift back to budget friendly Green Tea.",
