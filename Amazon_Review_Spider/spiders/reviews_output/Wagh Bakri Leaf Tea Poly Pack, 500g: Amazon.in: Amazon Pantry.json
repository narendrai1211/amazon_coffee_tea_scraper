We were using Wagh Bakri tea when we used to stay in Ahmedabad, but when we shifted to Bangalore we couldn't get it. We bought all different brands and tried most of the expensive ones as well. Needless to say, we missed it every single time.Now we found it on Amazon and it's the same old days back! Our guests keep complementing the taste of the tea. We love it!",

This tea brand has become a staple feature of my household's monthly grocery list.The flavor is excellent, unlike any other available in the market. I liked it the first time I tasted it and now I am addicted to it. My thrice daily tea fix is composed of a 1:1 blend of this flavor and its spiced version. I exhort everyone to try out the blend and see if your body can agree with it.I buy it only from Amazon because it is not easily available in physical stores, at least in New Delhi. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
