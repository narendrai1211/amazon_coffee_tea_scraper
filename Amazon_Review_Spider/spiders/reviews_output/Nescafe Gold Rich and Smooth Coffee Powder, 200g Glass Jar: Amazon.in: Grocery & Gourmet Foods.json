Boiling water is for steeping tea leaves. 1.25 table spoons of coffee + 300ml / one cup water = Strong Cup of CoffeeFor Latte : Milk + add lil water too + coffee + sugar to taste (2 tea spoon seems more than enough) 1.25 table spoons of coffee + 300ml milk + 50 / 100 ml waterBefore trying Nescafe Gold, I disliked black coffee but this particular stuff brought me to the dark side ;)Opened a whole new world to me.If you are a coffee beginner and want to develop taste for black coffee, get this one. ( you can start by getting 50gm version too.I go for 200gm. Now waiting for some offers on this new packaging for 2019.Update : 2+ years on this black gold stuff, loving every sip of it. Have gotten 15+ 200gms now.Tried it as1. Fusion drink with Japanese Matcha2. Use a milk frother to give it but of crema, that yummy part of espresso. Not close but try it.3. Orange zest Black CoffeeTip : If you have boiling water it might burn the coffee a bit, so add a touch of normal cold water, then make it.Tip : It can be used in electric drip machine too. I've made several times. No problems. Leaves no residue behind. Easy to clean too.Ultimate Barista Tip : Warm your cup with warm water before hand, then throw the water, now make the coffee. Coffee served on warm ceramic cups tastes better and remains warm for a long time.Happy Coffee Brewing! ‚òïIf this review helped you, give it a thumbs up üëç Cheers.",

Your new blend smells different, tastes different and leaves residue at the bottom of the cup. I have heard that you are trying to give it a more 'Barista' style - but why/ You already make Nescafe Barista..so if people actually want Barista style, they will pick one of your other brands. Sadly, as you do not have any other type of coffee, that tastes as smooth and mild as the 'original' Nescafe Gold Blend, I will have to find another brand. This will be very hard, as I have tried almost all of the other brands and types and nothing has come close to the taste of the original Gold Blend..... But, sadly, you leave me no choice.",

It tasted like salt, smelled like half roasted coffee, and the bottle's screw-on cap was literally garbage.This one, on the other hand, actually tastes like a slightly mild arabica blend (which is literally the best you can get with instant coffee - don't be expecting any bold flavors), smells like it was roasted for an acceptable amount of time, and the bottle has a lock-on cap (which is glorious, and I'm not kidding). Will most likely be buying this again.",

I have tried all coffee brands which are available in India. By far Davidoff and Nescafe are the best and Moreover this particular nescafe gold rich abd smooth coffee is the best . It is somewhat better or very much similar to Davidoff. Anyways go for it till its stocks last. Its the best coffee and u wont regret it. Now dont complain over its over bitterness as it is high in caffeine.",
