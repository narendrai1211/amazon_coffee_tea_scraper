I personally use tea bags more cause it's really convenient, although loose green teas are considered better. Anyway, from lipton to tetley to any small brand you can possibly think of I can assure you Typhoo is the BEST. Decent price, good quality wise and very efficient. So if you want to maintain weight, lose weight or get a daily dose of antioxidants, I would recommend this.",

Will suggest to consume green-tea without suger and milk (which people often do) for best results and to improve taste buds.Surely recommend.Thanks to Amazon for fast shipment.",

The tea bags have their left corner cut a bit so when we want to use, we can easily tear it off. However, this time when I ordered, the corner wasn't cut properly making it rough to open tea bag.The tea is good like any other green tea. I prefer it because you don't have to constantly dip like many other teas.",
