Nothing instant about it.My daily routine included having 2 cups of this green tea for a prolonged term of 2 months. Out of my 100 servings I never experienced that refreshing kick the brand promises and rather the taste is really disgusting. Let's admit, we all drink green tea like medicine.Rather than trusting condensed soiled up leaves in a tea bag(picture attached). I recommend switching to green tea leaves as you can see what your drinking.I'm personally switching over to coffee as it delivers the required punch to get me going...||Wish you a Safe and Worthy purchase||",

One thing that I don't like about normal green was it flavour because it taste Pathetic like you are having look wram water but thanks to Tetley flavored green tea  now I can have it everyday and get benefits of it. I prefer Tetley lemon honey green tea over ginger mint one. Tetley lemon honey has a very sublime taste which is not very strong to the nose but still you can sense it while having a sip. I bought this 100 packs tea bag for 400/- with a good discount from Amazon. So technically it tea bag cost me 4/- which is I feel very cost friendly. One I don't like about bthe product is it's packaging. Box is not very strudy. So if you want to have the benefits of green tea along with a nice flavor please go for it. I would surely recommend everyone to go for  this product.",

One can easily make out the flavours of lemon and honey even by the smell once you pour some hot water to the cup dipped with this tea..The tastes vary person to person, hence I'd not say whether I'd recommend it to others or not, but for now it has satisfied me and  I'm sticking with this tea for my daily usage.",
