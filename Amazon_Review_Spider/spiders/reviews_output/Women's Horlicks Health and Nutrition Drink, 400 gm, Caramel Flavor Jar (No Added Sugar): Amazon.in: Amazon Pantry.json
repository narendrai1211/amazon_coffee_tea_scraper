To name a few brands - Boost was one of my favourites , Bournvita was second favourite I stopped using bournvita because after sometime you will not like the chocolate flavour anymore and Now my favourite brand is HORLICKS. It comes in different flavours like chocolate, caramel, classic, kesar badam and elaichi. I don't really liked the chocolate flavour much though all other flavours are extremely addictive.In terms of price. It is very costly. 500gms of classic refill pack cost more than 200 Rs.'Classic' variant was once sold with the 'regular' name. It is the lowest cost variant among other flavours. It tastes as great as other flavours. Honestly you need not have to go for other flavours. The classic one is as delicious as Elaichi, Kesar badam or caramel.Caramel taste is just like alpenliebe toffee. I will definitely buy again.To make your Hot cup of milk you need to add three heaped spoon of the malt into the boiled hot milk and stir immediately to avoid forming lumps and stir it for few seconds. You need not have to add sugar at all as this will give just enough sweetness to your drink. Enjoy this warm drink at night before bed :)Hope this review is helpful to you.",

So I bought it.One thing I didn't understand is why the manufacturers have put in both calcium and iron. Anywhere you read on the internet, it says that iron and calcium inhibit each other's absorption, so shouldn't be taken together.I checked many other such health drink mixes. All have the same problem. So either these manufacturers have got their fundae wrong, or all those websites on the internet are spreading falsehood.Anyway, I decided to stop using it until I got clarity on this issue.It tastes really good though. You are tempted to just eat it straight out of the box. So if you can afford it for its taste alone, go for it.",
