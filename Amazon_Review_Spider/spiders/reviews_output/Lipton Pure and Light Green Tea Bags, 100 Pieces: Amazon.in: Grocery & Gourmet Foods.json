This was my third or fourth purchase of Lipton green tea on Amazon. While I had good experiences with earlier products, this specific order really baffled me. This is ABSOLUTELY not green tea; it doesn't taste like green tea, it doesn't look like green tea. While green tea, when brewed, gives off a pale yellow colour, this one releases a reddish (the colour of normal black tea) colour. If you brew green tea for more than 2/3 minutes, it releases its bitter notes; however, this specific product from Lipton doesn't do that even if you brew for 15 minutes. Another aspect of green tea is that it takes a little time (around 2 minutes) to brew, but put a tea bag of this particular product, the water is instantly red. (See pictures).What is confusing to me is that the earlier orders of this same product were absolutely ok. What happened to this one, did they put normal tea in packets marked as \"Pure & Light Green Tea\"? I don't know. But I am done with Lipton.",

It feels good to drink the green tea.If you want strong cup of tea then take less water and vice versa for a lesser strong tea.Overall it is usable. Good to start with. You can continue discovering different tea brands till the time you find that perfect tea.This is also cost effective approximately 3.5 per tea cup.go with smallert pack. You can then order more in case it fits your taste.",
