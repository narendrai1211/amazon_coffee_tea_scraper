The whole pack includes 25 infusion bags and 3 flavored bags...First I'll tell you about the flavor bags... I have got flavors of apple cinnamon, honey lemon green tea and a normal green tea.. You may have the green tea any time you want... It is basically for normal consumption... Honey lemon green tea can be consumed early in the morning when you crave for something a little stronger to kick away your sleep... It will really help you... Moreover if you exercise then it's really great for you to increase your metabolism... Consume it before your workout... And aahh! The apple cinnamon is so strong.. It is best when you are having a really hectic day and you want something really calming... It is the best option as it will give a good kick to your mind...Now let's talk about the chamomile infusion bags.. On being made, they are so fresh and flowery... It's like it can wake you up instantly or energize you anytime... I have made a habit of consuming this at night... After all the day's heavy work it relaxes you and calms you down... And since it doesn't contain any caffeine hence your sleep wouldn't be disturbed...",

Not very flavourful but ok. For the sleep and relaxation purpose, I didn’t find any particular changes in me. I received 25 bags plus two extra sample of their another range( I really liked lemon grass green tea sample, definitely gonna order that next time).",
